# Running on a device #

This is a widget only project, there is no default activity. You need to
configure the project to launch without a launch activity. You can do this in
Android Studio by Run -> Edit Configurations -> Launch Options: Launch ->
Nothing. Now run the project on your device and you should be able to add the
widget to the home screen.
